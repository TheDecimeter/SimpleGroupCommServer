# SimpleGroupCommServer
Simple room based server for old phones

Not remotely usable

This server hopes to be deployed on old phones to handle simple signaling tasks. There will probably be no encryption/verification in the immediate future.

Map:
See which is better, Java or C++
- Create two servers which can add and remove clients as well as pass messages between clients
- See how fast each version can relay messages, as well as how many clients each can store
  - If Java loses this by a little, it will probably still be used since it provides more convenient access to Android's security libraries (and is more future proof)
- Use whatever version performs best
